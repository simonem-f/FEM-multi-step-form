## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

## My process

A very basic Angular project setup: no routing, no services (no REST API however) and other cool stuff, because I only wanted to experiment with Angular reactive forms.

I also didn't add any other component beyond app component, a thing instead I definetly should have done (very long template... ðŸ˜…), but typescript logic was very easy with form builder and ui kit libraries, so I decideded to keep the things simple, in one place.

I started with page layout (sidebar + content) and made it response (mobile first and then desktop) with carousel skeleton and forms content.
After that I focused on the dynamic behaviour (typescript): steps navigation and forms validation / summary.
In the end I styled fine details.

### Built with

- HTML5
- SCSS
- Typescript
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Angular](https://angular.io/) - Web Dev Framework
- [NG Bootstrap](https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/) - Bootsrap for Angular (carousel without a common slide template)
- [Prime NG](https://primeng.org/setup) - Ready to use UI components for simple use cases (forms & inputs)

### What I learned

Basically I wanted to experiment with Angular reactive forms, which I never tried before, so to me this was the goal of this challenge. A very very handy, practical and powerful way to design forms.
